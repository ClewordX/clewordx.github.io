## Why "previous-generation"?

One must understand that for at least the last 40-or-so years, when it comes to computers and information technologies, we have been constantly burying ourselves in the local optimum, nearly completely oblivious to what has been achieved when what we considered as matters of fact nowadays didn't even exist and what has always been able to achieve with existing technologies. 

## The purpose of ClewordX

The ultimate goal of the ClewordX project is to create (part of) the basis for a global education material distributing and administering system with near-zero diminishes of marginal returns achieved under the help of computer technologies.
